                <p class="postParagraph">Texting and Driving is am extremely serious issue these years. With the rapid increase of traffic on the roads and smartphones, people often become distracted while driving. Around 1 million crashes around the U.S. are happening due to
                    distractions. How could we address these issue and stop putting our lives under the danger - that is the idea of these public service announcement (PSA) video.<br></p>
                <h5 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Topic and conflict</strong><br></h5>
                <p class="postParagraph">The central topic of the PSA is texting and driving. The video reveals three main types of driving distractions - visual, manual and cognitive, and how they affect us. It was revealed that texting while driving combines all types and pose
                    a great threat for the drivers.<br></p><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/bigstock-Man-Typing-Text-Message-On-Mob-254971870-825x500.jpg">
                <h5 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;">Why PSA??<br></h5>
                <p class="postParagraph">Public Service Announcement is a great instrument to make the public think about several everyday problems. Besides presenting the issue in several ways, PSA also provides the resolution for the public issues. But most importantly, the
                    main goal of the PSA is to persuade people to take an action which can be anything. Everything starts from a single person, and collectively, we could make the difference.<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">When developing the PSA, it is important to get the idea of problem-solving model described in the book technical communication. To begin with, we started to dive deeper into the problem asking serious questions about the issue. How many
                    people become victims of texting and driving? What are the types of distractions caused by the phone? Why texting while driving is especially dangerous?<br>The academic sources presented below clearly addressed the mentioned questions
                    numerically, and they were quite shocking! The audience often looks at the statistics to get the shape of the picture of how serious the problem is. By doing that, the PSA successfully persuades the audience to pay the attentions for
                    their everyday habits while driving by making appeal to&nbsp;<strong>logos.</strong><br></p>
                <div class="quotation-wrapper">
                    <p class="postParagraph" style="color: rgb(79,79,79);margin-left: 16px;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px;font-weight: bold;"><strong>Logos&nbsp;</strong>is a rhetorical or persuasive appeal to the audience's logic and rationality.<br></p>
                </div>
                <p class="postParagraph">The resolutions are pretty simple. First of all, silence your phone! Secondly, put the phone into the glove box to avoid instinctive taking. Many people know these very well, but the problem is that not all follow this advice. So, the
                    PSA is mainly targeted to convince them to follow these rules by making an appeal to&nbsp;<strong>pathos&nbsp;</strong>at the "Resolution Stage" to make the resolutions seem powerful and significant. We achieve such effect by adding
                    the suitable background soundtrack "Stirring Clouds" by Thomas Edmund Bootle. Furthermore, the rhetorical questions also send a powerful emotional appeal to the audience throughout the video:&nbsp;Can any message be worth more than
                    your life or the lives of people close to you?&nbsp;<br></p>
                <div class="quotation-wrapper">
                    <p class="postParagraph" style="color: rgb(79,79,79);margin-left: 16px;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px;font-weight: bold;">Pathos is an element in experience or in artistic representation evoking pity or compassion.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h5 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;">Final thoughts</h5>
                <p class="postParagraph">Overall, I believe that this public service announcement would enable people to care about themselves while driving by following simple advice. Hopefully, many people would take it seriously and&nbsp;rethink their current driving habits.&nbsp;<br></p>
