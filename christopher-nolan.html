            <h1 class="display-4" id="postTitle" style="font-size: 32px;text-align: left;font-family: Nunito, sans-serif;">Christopher Nolan infographic | Universal Principles of Design&nbsp;<br></h1>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 64px;margin-top: 64px;">
                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;">Intro<br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">Today, I am going to analyze the infographic of my classmate Zhalgasbek with whom we are taking the Writing for Digital Media university course.&nbsp;The infographic tells about the works of famous film director Christopher Nolan and a
                    couple of interesting facts about his professional life. There are two primary parts in the infographic presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2.<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">In order to provide my classmate with valuable feedback, I am going to review how he uses the concepts of iconography, form, and semiotics to establish close connections with readers. Specifically, I will examine how he conveys the main
                    message to the readers through the design principles including color, alignment and framing.<br></p><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/FirstDraft_1.png">
                <p class="postParagraph">Figure 1. Christopher Nolan and movies<br></p><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/FirstDraft_2.png">

                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Color</strong><br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">Before&nbsp;starting the analysis of the infographic’s color, let’s give an accurate definition for the role of the color in the design. <br></p>
                <div class="quotation-wrapper">
                    <p class="postParagraph" style="color: rgb(79,79,79);margin-left: 16px;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px;font-weight: bold;">Color is used in design to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics.<br></p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col text-left col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-12"><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/ColorPallete1.png" style="text-align: center;height: 280px;width: 300px;">
                        <p class="postParagraph">Figure 3. Color palette from first part<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col"><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/ColorPallete2.png" style="width: 300px;text-align: center;">
                        <p class="postParagraph">Figure 4. Color palette from second part<br></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="postParagraph">The infographic uses the powerful classic combination of a black background with a white content part shown in Figure 1. The&nbsp;<strong>combination of colors</strong>&nbsp;presented in Figure 3 gives a&nbsp;<strong>saturated</strong>&nbsp;shade
                    of mystery and grandeur around the main protagonist - Christopher Nolan. The background with the picture of the famous director immediately captures the reader's attention and prepares them to get the content of the infographic. By
                    using that combination of colors (in Figure 1) improves the design aesthetics and make the infographic look as a professional movie brochure.<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">Switching the eye to Figure 2, we see that the color of the text does not match the background color. Having a various background color in different parts of the infographic is very risky as you want to establish the comprehensive visual
                    flow of the infographic. Changing the black background to the grey-bluish significantly deteriorates the visual quality of the infographic, and it creates a feeling of reading different work. </p>
                <p class="postParagraph">My recommendation would be to change the background color of the second section either to the black color or to set the color which is compatible with the background of the first section. To find a compatible color, the <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">Colorhunt website</a>&nbsp;provides
                    you with the qualitative color palettes for the visuals. Another advice would be to stick to one color palette to avoid color desaturation and loss of reader interest.&nbsp;Therefore, color selection and matching are essential when
                    talking about the aesthetics of the infographic.<br></p>
                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Alignment</strong><br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">Let's switch our attention on the another northworthy design principle called&nbsp;<strong>alignment</strong>. Alignment is a placement of elements in which they are centralised or their edges line up along common rows or columns.<br></p>
                <div
                    class="row">
                    <div class="col text-left col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-12"><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/FirstDraft_4.png" style="text-align: center;height: 382px;width: 264px;">
                        <p class="postParagraph">Figure 5. Alignment problems<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col"><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/FirstDraft_3.png" style="width: 264px;text-align: center;">
                        <p class="postParagraph">Figure 6. Text is outside of the invisible column<br></p>
                    </div>
            </div>
            <p class="postParagraph">Let’s focus our attention on the statistics section concerning the movies of Christopher Nolan. The movie name comes under the two icons “Critics” and “Audience” with numbers. In Figure 5 and 6, there is a distinguishable alignment pattern
                in which icon objects and texts have the left-side as a starting point. However, when it comes to movies with long titles, they start to break the alignment pattern. In Figure 6, “The Dark Knight”, “Inception”, and “The Dark Knight Rises”
                have different positions what make statistics look a little bit unorganized as the text titles break the vertical invisible column. <br></p>
            <p class="postParagraph">So, I&nbsp;suggest using the central alignment for movie titles that come under icons while keeping the same place for the icons. An alternative solution would be placing long movie titles in a broader area while keeping the left-side as a
                starting point. For instance, “The Dark Knight Rises” title may swap with “Following” title as the latter has more space for the text.<br></p>
            <p class="postParagraph">The second section of the infographic (shown in Figure 2) also has a centralized alignment pattern. What I would suggest for this section is to increase the height of the title area “Interesting Facts” to make more emphasis on ongoing information.
                <br></p>
            <p class="postParagraph">Overall,&nbsp;Zhalgasbek&nbsp;takes advantage of alignment design principle making the infographic look structured and easy to comprehend while also setting the cohesive information flow.<br></p>
            <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;">Framing</h3>
            <p class="postParagraph">Previously, we analyzed design choices, elements. Now, let's look at the content or how successful design choices are in expressing the main message of the infographic. The technique that represents the way the information is presented is
                called&nbsp;<strong>framing</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Semiotics&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>form&nbsp;</strong>also take place when reviewing the framing as they also reveal the messages that the author wants to convey to the audience.<br></p>
            <img
                class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/indexes.png" style="width: 196px;">
                <p class="postParagraph">Figure 7. Critics consensus and Audience acceptance<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">The infographic uses some signifiers such as indexes and symbols to convey the statistics and interesting facts in a clear way. Figure 1 tells us about critics consensus and audience acceptance around the movies of Christopher Nolan. Specifically,
                    these two aspects expressed in the form of indexes supplemented by numerics as shown in Figure 7. But does this statistics successfully reveal the message to the audience? Does it engage the readers? </p>
                <p class="postParagraph">At this point, my recommendation would be to represent these statistics differently. As for now, the&nbsp;<br>"critics consensus" and&nbsp;"audience acceptance" have a neutral look and value. So, I suggest adding some engaging elements
                    such as colors and fonts for both icons. For example, "critics consensus" would be highlighted with a red color while the "audience acceptance" with the green color. Make readers think your numbers are showing something important.
                    To make numbers look powerful, you could change their fonts or increase their size. Just change the form.</p><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/Figure%208.png">
                <p class="postParagraph">Figure 8. Three major cloud types<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">Another important aspect when developing infographic is to create the form and iconography that fit the content of the page. In Figure 2, the "Interesting facts" section should include creative design elements to make the context look
                    interesting. The title "Interesting facts" must give a rhythm to the design of a context. Besides the advice I provided above on the color of this section, I would also recommend changing the iconography and form of the page. Consider
                    organizing the facts in 3 separated vertical columns as shown in Figure 8. So, I would advise organizing every section's iconography and color look different from one another that fully addresses a particular fact.</p>
                <h3 class="postHeading"
                    style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Final Points</strong><br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">I think that&nbsp;Zhalgasbek&nbsp;effectively used the knowledge from the Universal Principles of Design and previous readings to establish the connections with the readers. He has already made a great job creating the attractive infographic
                    dedicated to the works of Christopher Nolan. Nevertheless, I believe that my advice would improve the aesthetics and design of the infographic and most importantly, would encourage my classmate to develop valuable design skills in
                    his future projects.<br></p>
