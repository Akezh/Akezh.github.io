            <h1 class="display-4" id="postTitle-1" style="font-size: 32px;text-align: left;font-family: Nunito, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;">Infographic of Infographics&nbsp; |&nbsp; What do best writers choose when creating modern-day infographics?<br></h1>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 64px;margin-top: 64px;">
                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;">Introduction<br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">In the dynamically developing world, the amount of data and concepts are growing at a rapid pace. The amount of data generated in the last 20 years exceeds the entire historical collection of data multiple times. One of the effective ways
                    to utilize the data and describe the complex concepts in a clear and simplified fashion - is presenting information through infographics.&nbsp;<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">Modern-day infographics use different methods to effectively communicate with readers. But what is the secret of creating trendy infographics? Today we are going to uncover that secret and analyze the real-world example of infographic
                    through the concepts of iconography, semiotics, genre conventions and form.<br></p>
                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Genre</strong><br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph">To begin with, the author and designer of the infographic, Ivan Cash, expressly chooses the genre of infographics to effectively demonstrate the design and content trends in infographics.&nbsp;It is easy to identify the genre as it was
                    already defined in the hooky title “Infographic of Infographics” which is imprinted in the yellow tape. Besides the title, the multimodal resource follows the infographic genre conventions as it contains many, colourful elements including
                    the data charts, images and text which organized in an engaging and structured way.<br></p><img class="hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/info_info.png">
                <p class="postParagraph">Figure 1. Infographic of Infographics<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">One of the most important conventions of infographics is the well-organized content. Ivan Cash perfectly used spatial mode to organize the sections and subsections which makes the reading process convenient for people. There are two main
                    sections that identify the&nbsp;modern-day infographic: "Design" and "Content."&nbsp;Every section has five subsections that were perfectly divided by the dotted lines and space margins.<br></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">The design section expresses the popular design choices used in the modern-day infographic. The author uses statistics supported by the colourful visuals to simplify the interpretation of the text. For example, Figure 2 shows what types
                    of charts are commonly chosen in a modern-day infographic. </p>
                <p class="postParagraph">The subgenre of the multimodal resource is static statistical infographic. We refer to it as "static" because the infographic does not have any dynamic components which could change the view of the multimodal text.<br></p>
                <div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/infographic_charts.png" style="width: initial;height: initial;/*align-items: center;*/"></div>
                <p class="postParagraph">Figure 2. Popular chart styles<br></p>
                <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Semiotics</strong><br></h3>
                <p class="postParagraph"></p>
                <p class="postParagraph">Undoubtedly, infographics use lots of imagery, icons and symbols supported by the text to convey the information as simple as possible to the reader. This approach of writing applies the concept called semiotics which uses signs that are
                    associated with the idea the author wants to convey.</p>
                <p class="postParagraph">Infographics tend to take advantage of using different signifiers like icons, symbols, and indexes to establish communication with readers. For instance, the chart style section applies mainly icons to present the data visualization tools
                    including pie chart, line chart, bar chart and pictorial chart (see Figure 2). By using icons which has a physical similarity with a signified, the designer simplifies the process of absorbing the statistical information for readers.<br></p>
                <p
                    class="postParagraph">In Figure 3, the writer uses icons of arrows and lines that imitate the actual objects used in navigational iconography. When a reader notices the icons, he immediately understands what the author is talking about (that these signs are
                    used in navigation) and ready to read statistics regarding the frequency of icons in infographics.</p>
                    <div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/infographic_navigationalicon.png" style="width: initial;height: initial;/*align-items: center;*/"></div>
                    <p class="postParagraph">Figure 3. Navigation iconography<br></p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">As we previously defined the subgenre of the multimodal resource – statistical infographics, we could confidently claim that these genres require the most accurate and precise language and words. That is the reason why the author uses
                        mainly denotation to provide a reader with accurate information and literal meaning of the word.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Iconography and form</strong><br></h3>
                    <p class="postParagraph">Let us analyze now other two visual art concepts named the iconography and form. Iconography is the science that interprets the meaning of objects such as images and artworks. In a nutshell, the iconography mainly focuses on what is
                        shown and what this intended to convey to the audience. Similarly, the form is the branch of science that investigates how the design, view or shape of the objects including paintings, sculptures or images conveys the message to
                        people.<br></p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">To begin with, the background has a monotone beige colour. It is worth noting that wide prism of colours perfectly matches with the beige colour. By avoiding a multicoloured background or background image, the author enables the readers
                        to directly focus on the main, infographic content.<br></p>
                    <div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/infographic_pie.png" style="width: initial;height: initial;/*align-items: center;*/"></div>
                    <p class="postParagraph">Figure 4. Base color used by infographics<br></p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">The author mainly uses statistics as a way to visualize the numerical data in the design part. In Figure 4, he builds a chart through a diverse spectrum of colours to make the data look clear and attractive. People usually associate
                        statistics as complex and boring stuff. However, the use of iconography and form with icons and suitable colours makes the statistics look cool and easy to comprehend. The author's hidden message was probably to show to people
                        that the statistical infographic is the genre where statistics visualization must be a priority. <br></p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">For example, the author carefully chooses the sequence of well-matched colours while the font size of percentage numbers are suited according to the pie chart's portion. Moreover, by showing this pie chart with popular base colours,
                        the author also leaves a valuable colour palette that can be furtherly utilized by the audience in their projects.<br></p>
                    <div class="text-center"><img class="img-fluid hearthstone-img" src="assets/img/infographic_citation.png" style="width: initial;height: initial;/*align-items: center;*/"></div>
                    <p class="postParagraph">Figure 5. Average number of words used in infographic titles<br></p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">In Figure 5, the author indicates the average number of words used in the infographic title. At first glance, he picked simple title with incomplete 5th word "NEIGH" as an example to convey the statistical message that fraction .36
                        is equivalent to "NEIGH". However, his choice of words is not random and they targeted to also catch the readers attention with a hooky title provided below. By choosing it, the author intended to give important advice when thinking
                        about infographic titles. Specifically, the titles should be hooky and catch the audience attention from the first glance.</p>

                    <h3 class="postHeading" style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br></h3>
                    <p class="postParagraph">The infographic of infographics has the elements of iconography, semiotics and form to comprehensibly represent the information to readers. The multimodal source is well supported by the visual, spatial modes by including different
                        images, icons, styled texts while also organizing these visuals in a plain and ordered way. I think that this statistical infographic is a perfect example of the modern-day infographic as it follows fundamental genre conventions
                        and uses advanced design choices that it describes.</p>
                    <p class="postParagraph">So, I hope that this blog post along with the example itself described you the secret ingredients of creating a successful infographic. It is worth noting that the range of ingredients vary widely and also depends on the subgenre of
                        an infographic.<br></p>
